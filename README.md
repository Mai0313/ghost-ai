👻 **An invisible AI-powered desktop assistant that captures, analyzes, and provides insights**

Ghost AI is a privacy-first cross-platform desktop application built with Electron and TypeScript. It provides three core features: text input with screenshot analysis, voice recording with real-time conversation support, and stealth operation interface. The system integrates directly with OpenAI API through global hotkeys, with all API settings configurable through the frontend interface, offering seamless AI assistance while remaining completely invisible to screen sharing and monitoring software.

**Other Languages**: [English](README.md) | [繁體中文](README_cn.md)

## ✨ Features

### 👻 **Invisible Operation**

- **Ghost Mode**: Completely invisible during screenshots and screen sharing
- **Stealth Hotkeys**: Low-level keyboard hooks that avoid detection by monitoring software
- **Hidden Process**: Disguised process names and window titles for maximum privacy
- **Memory-Only Images**: Images are processed entirely in memory; they never touch disk. Plain-text Q/A conversation is logged per session under `~/.ghost-ai/logs/<sessionId>/<sessionId>.log` for debugging/inspection.

### ⚡ **Lightning Fast Capture**

- **Global Hotkeys**: Trigger screenshots from any application with customizable key combinations
- **Instant Analysis**: Real-time image analysis using OpenAI's Vision API
- **Smart Prompting**: Store prompt files under `~/.ghost-ai/prompts` and switch the active prompt in Settings (editing is done outside the app)
- **Multiple Capture Modes**: Full screen, active window, or custom region selection

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Intelligence**

- **OpenAI Vision**: Advanced image understanding and analysis capabilities
- **Context-Aware**: Provide custom prompts to get specific insights about your screenshots
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanisms and graceful error recovery
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in API quota management and request optimization
- **Simple Conversation Memory**: Keeps a plain‑text Q/A history in memory per session for prompt composition; after each request completes, the current session’s conversation text is also written to `~/.ghost-ai/logs/<sessionId>/<sessionId>.log`.
- **Default Prompt Injection (first turn only)**: The active prompt from `~/.ghost-ai/prompts/default.txt` is injected only on the first turn of each session. Subsequent turns include only your question and the plain‑text conversation history. Regeneration preserves the original first‑turn prompt in prior context.
- **Top-level Session**: A `sessionId` is created on app start and whenever you press Clear (Cmd/Ctrl+R). All capture and transcription events carry this `sessionId`, and conversation logs are written to `~/.ghost-ai/logs/<sessionId>/<sessionId>.log` for easier correlation.
  - A structured Session Store is also maintained in memory and persisted to `~/.ghost-ai/logs/<sessionId>/<sessionId>.json`, recording each send with `{ index, requestId, log_path, text_input, ai_output }`.

### 🔒 **Privacy & Security**

- **Images never persisted**: Screenshots are processed in RAM only and are not saved to disk
- **Conversation logs**: For debugging, the app writes the current plain-text Q/A conversation to `~/.ghost-ai/logs/<sessionId>/<sessionId>.log` after each analyze request completes. This fix ensures new sessions create proper separate log paths without mixing with previous sessions. Interrupted conversations (via Ctrl+R) are not logged to prevent race conditions.
- **Encrypted Communication**: All API calls use HTTPS with certificate pinning
- **Keylogger Detection**: Warns users about potential privacy risks from monitoring software
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Memory and network traces are automatically cleared

### 🎨 **User Experience**

- **Floating HUD**: A modern top‑center control bar (bar‑only by default) with Listen, Ask, Hide, and Settings
- **Unified Ask card with pagination (streaming‑only)**: The AI response and the input are combined into one card. Within the same session, past answers are shown as pages with Prev/Next controls and a page indicator (e.g., `2/5`). While streaming, you can stay on an older page; use Next to jump back to Live at any time.
- **Unified rendering for answers and transcripts**: Both analyze responses and realtime transcripts stream into the same reply area using a shared render sink (append/finish). Transcript segments are also saved into the same paginated history as `{ user, assistant }` (assistant initially mirrors the transcript) so you can page through them just like AI answers.
- **Regenerate on transcript pages**: Select a transcript page and click Regenerate to run analysis using that transcript as the question. The assistant content for that page is replaced in place; the original transcript remains as the preceding user message for context.
- **Regenerate on completed page**: After an answer finishes, a Regenerate button appears. Clicking it resends the original question for that page using only the prior conversation context (excluding that page), producing a new answer in place without creating a new page.
- **Elegant validation feedback**: API settings tests show clear visual feedback with icons and color-coded notifications
- **Fixed hotkeys (all are global)**: Ask = Cmd/Ctrl+Enter, Voice Toggle = Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Enter (realtime transcription), Toggle Hide = Cmd/Ctrl+\\, Clear Ask = Cmd/Ctrl+R (also resets voice state), Scroll Up/Down = Cmd/Ctrl+Up/Down, Prev/Next Page = Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down
- **Listen controls**: While recording, you can Pause/Resume live transcript without stopping the session, or Stop to end recording.
- **Edge-friendly overlay**: The overlay is full‑screen and click‑through by default; it only captures mouse input when you hover the HUD or bubbles. This prevents invisible blockers and lets you drag the bar to the very top/bottom edges.
- **Inline error messages**: If something goes wrong, errors show inline where the AI answer appears, so you can retry immediately
- **Quick clear / Interrupt**: Press Cmd/Ctrl+R anytime to abort an in‑progress AI answer, clear the Ask bubble and conversation history, and start a brand‑new session instantly
- **Minimal Friction**: Prompt composer with custom prompt field and Send button
- **Customizable Settings**: Personalize hotkeys, default prompts, and behavior
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Scrollbar styling**: The AI answer panel uses a custom thin, rounded scrollbar that matches the dark panel aesthetics. You can tweak it in `src/renderer/styles/blocknote-custom.css`.

### 🏗️ **Modern Architecture**

- **Frontend-Only Application**: Pure Electron + TypeScript with no backend dependencies
- **UI Framework**: React for responsive and modern user interface
- **Direct API Integration**: OpenAI SDK integrated directly in the main process
- **Frontend Configuration**: All API settings configurable through the user interface
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type annotations throughout the codebase
- **Memory-First**: All processing happens in memory without disk persistence

### Overlay click‑through behavior

- The main window is a transparent, full‑screen overlay with no frame/shadow.
- It starts in click‑through mode so your desktop/apps remain interactive.
- When your cursor enters the HUD or bubbles, the app temporarily disables click‑through so you can click/drag; it re‑enables click‑through when you move away.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** for the Electron application
- **OpenAI API Key** for AI analysis features

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mai0313/ghost-ai.git
   cd ghost-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure your OpenAI API settings**

   The application will prompt you to configure your OpenAI API settings on first run:
   - API Key
   - Base URL (optional, defaults to https://api.openai.com/v1)
   - Model selection
   - Other preferences

   All settings are stored securely using Electron's built-in encryption.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the application in development mode**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Fixed hotkeys (global)**
   - **Ask (toggle Ask panel)**: `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` (press again to collapse)
   - **Voice (realtime transcription)**: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Enter` — captures microphone and (where permitted) system audio, with client-side audio batching (~220 ms or 32 KB) to improve stability while keeping latency low. Uses `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` by default.
   - **Toggle Hide**: `Cmd/Ctrl+\\` (works even if the HUD was hidden via the Hide button)
   - **Clear Ask**: `Cmd/Ctrl+R` (also stops recording and resets voice state)
   - **Scroll Up/Down** (Ask/Transcript content): `Cmd/Ctrl+Up` / `Cmd/Ctrl+Down`
   - **Prev/Next Page** (pagination within a session): `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Up` / `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Down`

3. **Build for production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### First Use

1. Press your configured hotkey to capture a screenshot
2. Use the top control bar to switch between Ask and Settings
3. Enter your question and click Send. The active prompt from `~/.ghost-ai/prompts` is applied automatically on the first turn of a session.
4. View the AI response inside the bubble. Answers are rendered as Markdown with proper formatting. Code blocks are shown without syntax highlighting.

npm install <package> --save-dev        # Add dev dependency
```

### Packaging

```bash
npm run dist   # Build and package for your platform
```

#### OS-specific packaging notes

- Windows: `npm run dist:win` produces an NSIS installer under `release/` (e.g., `Ghost AI Setup <version>.exe`).
- macOS: `npm run dist:mac` must be run on macOS (DMG creation and code signing require macOS).
- Linux: `npm run dist:linux` must be run on a Linux environment for best results (AppImage/deb). On Windows, use WSL2 or a Linux machine.
- All artifacts are written to the `release/` directory. Use `--publish never` (default in scripts) to avoid accidental uploads.

### Application Icon

- Windows installer and app icon use `ghost.ico` in the project root.
- To change the icon, replace the file `ghost.ico` and rebuild:

```bash
npm run dist
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Capture Flow

1. **Hotkey Trigger**: Press your configured global hotkey (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+S`)
2. **Invisible Mode**: Application immediately hides all windows
3. **Screenshot Capture**: System captures the current screen to memory
4. **Prompt Input**: UI appears for you to enter analysis instructions
5. **AI Analysis**: Image and prompt sent to OpenAI Vision API (streaming-only)
6. **Results Display**: Answer streams live above the input; on errors, an inline `Error: ...` shows in the same bubble, and you can retry right away. The app is streaming‑only; legacy non‑streaming chat flows have been removed.
7. **Memory Cleanup**: All traces automatically cleared from memory
8. **Conversation Memory**: After each answer, the app appends `Q:`/`A:` lines to an in‑memory string; on the next turn, it sends that history plus the new question. The current conversation text is also written to `~/.ghost-ai/logs/<sessionId>/<sessionId>.log`.

### Privacy Protection

- **No Disk Storage**: Screenshots never saved to disk
- **Memory Processing**: All image data processed in RAM only
- **Stealth Operation**: Invisible to screen recording and sharing
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypted API calls
- **Process Hiding**: Disguised process names and window titles
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Memory and network traces cleared on exit

### AI Integration

- **OpenAI Vision API**: State-of-the-art image understanding
- **Custom Prompts**: Tailor analysis to your specific needs
- **Context Awareness**: AI understands both image content and your questions
- **Error Recovery**: Robust handling of API failures and rate limits
- **Response Optimization**: Intelligent caching and request batching

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Hotkey Customization

Edit the hotkey configuration in the settings:

```typescript
// Default hotkey: Ctrl+Shift+S
const defaultHotkey = 'CommandOrControl+Shift+S';

// Custom hotkey examples:
// "CommandOrControl+Alt+G"     // Ctrl+Alt+G (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Alt+G (macOS)
// "CommandOrControl+Shift+A"   // Ctrl+Shift+A (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+A (macOS)
// "F12"                        // Function key F12
```

### API Configuration

Configure your OpenAI API settings through the application's settings interface:

- **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key (stored securely using Electron's safeStorage)
- **Base URL**: Custom API endpoint (defaults to https://api.openai.com/v1)
- **Model**: Choose from available models (dynamically fetched from OpenAI)
- Note: The app does not set temperature or max tokens by default to maximize compatibility across models. If your selected model supports these, you can customize behavior by changing models or your prompts.
  - `OpenAIConfig.maxTokens` is retained in settings as a convenience and is typed as `number | null`. The default is `null`, which means "use the model's default/maximum tokens." This value is not sent to the API unless you explicitly re‑enable token limits in code; when `maxTokens` is `null` or `undefined`, omit the API parameter entirely.
- For `gpt-5` only, the app automatically sets `reasoning_effort: "low"` to reduce latency/cost. This parameter is not sent for other models to maintain compatibility.

All settings are encrypted and stored locally - no external services required.

### Troubleshooting

- If the model selector next to the Ask input stays on "Loading models…":
  - Open Settings and enter a valid OpenAI API key and Base URL.
  - The app now falls back to a default model list even when the API key is missing/invalid, so you can still pick a model. If requests later fail, verify your account has access to the selected model.
  - Changing settings triggers an automatic refresh in the Ask panel.

### Realtime Transcription Language

- In Settings → Transcription, you can choose the transcription language: **English (en)** or **中文 (zh)**. Default is **en**.
- This hint is sent to the realtime transcription session to reduce garbled characters when speaking Chinese (e.g., avoid outputs like `��得到嗎?`).

### UI customization (opacity and colors)

- To adjust overall opacity (both background and text), change the theme opacity in `src/renderer/styles/theme.ts`:

```96:96:src/renderer/styles/theme.ts
export const theme = makeTheme();
```

For example, `makeTheme(0.75)` makes the UI more transparent; values are 0–1.

- To change colors, edit the `palette` in the same file:

```54:65:src/renderer/styles/theme.ts
const palette = {
  text: [255, 255, 255],
  mutedText: [189, 189, 189],
  barBg: [30, 30, 30],
  settingsBg: [20, 20, 20],
  panelBg: [22, 22, 22],
  panelFooterBg: [24, 24, 24],
  inputBg: [22, 22, 22],
  border: [255, 255, 255],
  shadow: [0, 0, 0],
  primary: [43, 102, 246],
  danger: [255, 40, 40],
};
```

- Component styles are centralized in `src/renderer/styles/styles.ts` and consume the theme, so most tweaks should only require the edits above.

### Privacy Settings

Customize privacy and security options:

```typescript
interface PrivacySettings {
  stealthMode: boolean; // Hide from screen sharing
  memoryOnly: boolean; // Never save to disk
  autoCleanup: boolean; // Auto-clear memory traces
  processHiding: boolean; // Disguise process names
  keyloggerDetection: boolean; // Warn about monitoring software
}
```

### Prompts Directory

- Ghost AI loads prompts from `~/.ghost-ai/prompts`.
- The app always reads from `~/.ghost-ai/prompts/default.txt` as the effective prompt.
- Using the Settings panel to select a prompt will copy that file's content into `default.txt`.
- If `default.txt` does not exist, the app creates an empty `default.txt` on first run.
- To create or edit prompts, manage files directly in your editor (e.g., `general.txt`, `ui-review.md`).
